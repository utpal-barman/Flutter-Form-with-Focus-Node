# Flutter Form with Focus Node

Implementation of a form in flutter with using the widget `Form()`. This form uses `focusNode:`.

## Implementation

This is actually not a complete project, in this repository, I showed how to implement a form correctly with the focus node.

This project demonstrates how `TextFormFields()` communicate with each other, how to pass `FocusNode()` instance to any `TextFormFields()`. Also, it handles all active focus nodes by clicking dropdown menu.
```
Form(
          key: _formGlobalKey,
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Column(
              children: <Widget>[
              
                TextFormField(
                  focusNode: _textFocusNode1,
                  textInputAction: TextInputAction.next,
                  onFieldSubmitted: (_) {
                    // PASS THE FOCUS NODE TO NEXT FIELD
                    FocusScope.of(context).requestFocus(_textFocusNode2);
                  },  
                ),

                TextFormField(
                  focusNode: _textFocusNode2,
                  textInputAction: TextInputAction.next,
                  onFieldSubmitted: (_) {
                    // DON'T HAVE NEXT TEXT FIELD, UNFOCUS FOCUS-NODE
                    _textFocusNode2.unfocus(),
                  },
                  
                ),
   
                DropdownButtonFormField(
                  
                  //...some codes are omitted
                  
                  onChanged: (value) {
                    setState(() {
                      FocusScope.of(context).requestFocus(new FocusNode());
                      _selectedText = value;
                    });
                  },
                  
                  //... other codes like decoration, items etc.
                ),
                    
             ],
         ),
     ),
),
```

Putting this on the dropdown will unfocus all active focus node.

```
onChanged: (value) {
           setState(() {
                FocusScope.of(context).requestFocus(new FocusNode());
                _selectedText = value;
            });     
},
```
